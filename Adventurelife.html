<p class ="Adventure">Everyone deserves a good adventure and traveling is the best way to achieve it. Adventure travel – going beyond the sandy beaches and city breaks – can have plenty of benefits aside from providing you with enjoyment and memories. Here are the ten reasons adventure travel is good for you and why you might want to book your next holiday right away.</p>

<h2 class ="heading">1. Learn to stay cool under pressure</h2>
<p>Adventure travel will throw tricky situations on your way. But being faced with these situations will only help you learn how to deal with them better. You’ll gain strength and confidence to deal with life’s many sides. Next time you have an emergency at work, you can just close your eyes and think back on how the single bar of Bertie Beetle saved your life.</p>

<h3 class ="heading">2. Gain perspective on your life</h3>
<p>Seeing new situations, learning about nature at its rawest, and experiencing new cultures and traditions will give a new perspective on life. You will see your own troubles and the good things you have much clearer when things around you are so different from your own experiences. You can distance yourself from your current situation and take a fresh look at the things around you. Perhaps it’s time to learn a new skill at NewSkill.com.au or ditch the self-obsessed spouse.</p>

<h4 class ="heading">3. Prove your abilities</h4>
<p>Adventure travel is the perfect confidence booster. Surviving a night at the airport, sleeping in a tent under the stars next to Uluru, and eating Indomie instant noodles for two days in a row is bound to make you feel invincible. If you survive a good adventure with its vicissitudes, you’ll survive anything. You can better understand your strengths – perhaps you are great at managing conflict situations or your physical fitness is much better than you gave yourself credit for.</p>

<h5 class ="heading">4. Live within your means</h5>
<p>You won’t have access to life’s little luxuries on an adventure travel. In fact, you probably need to learn to use your limited budget and make the most out of it to be able to experience an adventure in the first place. You’ll learn to live within your means and find those secret online travel deals at OZCodes.com.au. You will become the master of managing your finances, creating big experiences from a few resources.
</p>

<h6 class ="heading">5. Forge new relationships</h6>
<p>
    Traveling is the best way to meet new friends or to strengthen your existing friendships. You’ll meet new people, creating long lasting relationships with people who you wouldn’t otherwise have met.But you’ll also learn to appreciate the friends you already have more when you’re not spending time with them.
</p>

<h2 class ="heading">6. Improve your health</h2>
<p>Outdoor activities have been shown to improve health and therefore, adventure travel can boost your wellbeing. You stay more active, you get fresh air and these will contribute to your health improving and staying strong. The best part about it is that you don’t even feel like doing a lot of work – you’ll be having fun, spending time with friends and being surrounded by amazing scenery and beautiful wildlife.</p>

<h2 class ="heading">7. Learn a new skill</h2>
<p>Whether you learn how to make ten different types of ropes, turn can of SAFCOL tuna into a delicious meal, or speak Spanish with the help of local herders (and Duolingo app), you are bound to learn something new. The skills will be put to use later on in life, no matter how obscure they might.</p>

<h3 class ="heading">8. Grow your brain</h3>
<p>Not only can you become healthier as a result of adventure travel, you are also going to boost your brainpower. According to a study, people who had exercised outdoors had more activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain than before the exercise. Furthermore, adventure has been shown to increase the activity in hippocampus, which is an important part of the brain in terms of memory and learning.</p>

<h4 class ="heading">9. Help local people</h4>
<p>Traveling can sometimes have a bad reputation, but there are responsible travel companies out there and eco-friendly travel is possible. In fact, if you are smart at picking your destinations, using guides like The Outbound Collective, you can put money into local communities and help people in the remote and poor parts of the world prosper. By visiting these destinations, you can help preserve them and grow the local economies.</p>

<h5 class ="heading">10. Realize your dreams</h5>
<p>You can realize your dreams with the help of adventure travel. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to see the Great Barrier Reef or spend time learning about Native American tribes. It can even be something such as doing things on you own or spending more time with your family – whatever your dreams, you can realize them during traveling and go even further.

    As the above shows, adventure travel is good for you in many different ways. It helps you feel better on the inside and outside, while providing you with tons of new experiences. You’ll gain new skills and knowledge, which you can put to good use later on in life. So, don’t wait any longer, but go out and experience an adventure!</p>
