<p class ="Scuba Diving">Scuba diving is perhaps the best way to explore the fantastic underwater world, 
    getting up close with the wonders and the secrets of this marine universe, with its breathtakingly colourful and diverse inhabitants. 
    Floating below the azure waters, 
    you are in an ethereal – sometimes hostile – environment, with a limited supply of air on your back and with only your fellow divers as your lifelines. 
    Over the years and the decades, scuba diving has evolved into a non-competitive but a very exciting adventure sport.
    SCUBA is the short form of ‘Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus’. It was developed in the mid-1940s by the world 
    famous underwater explorer and conservationist, Jacques-Yves Cousteau (with more than a little help from Émile Gagnan),
     for the French Navy during the Second World War. After the war, however, diving turned into a recreational sport, which has
      since been taken up by millions worldwide.</p>

<p class ="Scuba Diving">Andaman is one of the amazing creations of the Almighty.
     Situated right in the middle of the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, this archipelago has a number of stunningly beautiful
      beaches and scuba diving spots, Havelock Islands being one of the most popular. Located about 50 km away from Port Blair,
       the island has a wide range of exotic marine life like Humpback Parrotfish, Lionfish, soft corals, The rare dugongs and schools of colourful fishes.
        To get there, one can fetch a ferry from Port Blair which would take about 2.5 hours. There are many interesting sites
         upon reaching there like there is The Wall, Lighthouse, Aquarium, and Mac Point etc each with its own unique features.
          The hotels and resorts are also pretty good- affordable and up to the mark.  And yes, do not forget to take basic
           necessities with you ?like sunscreens, lotions, etc.
    because these things are not available there. Although the place has ATM's it might just be a little more advisable to take some hard cash with you.

<p class ="Scuba Diving">Netrani Island, also known as Pigeon Island, is located approximately 10 nautical miles from the temple town of Mudreshwar in Bhatkal Taluk. It is a beautiful diving spot, shaped in the form of a heart, fondly known as 'The heart of India's diving'.   It is a coral island and has a coral reef with varieties of coral, butterfly fish, parrot fish, eels and shrimps. If you are lucky enough, you might even see a whale or orcas. The island is mainly uninhabitated and due to the steep stones, it is advisable to do diving for a boat. The place is well connected from Goa, Mumbai, Mangalore and Bengaluru.</p>

<img src="E:\Advantures & Sports Agensy\travel website\images\S4.jpg" class ="skill-img" align="center" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:1600px;height:900px;">

<p class ="Canoeing">Kovalam is situated in Kerala, at a distance of about 16 km from Thiruvananthapuram. A beach area mainly, it is slowly developing into a popular scuba diving locale since the Bond Safari Kovalam has come there. Instead of using the traditional scuba gear, the company makes use of what is known as 'bond' submarine, which is basically an underwater scooter. So, that's quite interesting, isn't it? Moreover the waters here are really calm, with shoals of anchovy and silver moony, Bluefin trevaly, the odd Moray eel, puffer fish, groupers, box fish, sergeants, pipe fish etc. The place is well connected by railways and airports.</p>

<p class ="Scuba Diving">Okay, so this one is an atoll. It basically has coral reefs surrounding the entire island. The place is known for its serene and calm atmosphere. The place is located in the union territory of Lakshadweep islands. The underwater scenic beauty is simply stunning with the continuous coral reef and also has been considered at par with popular beach country like Maldives and Mauritius. One also gets to see a lot of barracudas. The fact that it is one of the cleanest beaches really elevates its standard. The connectivity is good and one can reach the island by taking a boat from Agatti (Agatti has an aerodrome too).</p>
