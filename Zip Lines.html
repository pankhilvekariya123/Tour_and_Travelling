<p class ="Zip Lines">Many of the ziplines mentioned below claim to be the longest zipline in the world. 
But this exhilarating zipline, in Ras al Khaimah, 
has been officially recognized by the Guinness World Records as being the longest one! 
It is a record-breaking  1.76 miles long (2.83kms).
It is also the fastest zipline in the world, reaching speeds of up to 100 miles per hour (160km per hr).
The other really cool thing about it is you get to strike your superman pose, 
as the zipline has you suspended face down, soaring at astonishing heights.</p>

<p class ="Zip Lines">The platform you launch from is also out-of-this-world. 
It is a free-standing platform with a see-through bottom, suspended from the mountains by mere cables.  
This gives you the ultimate sense of adventure as you launch into the unknown.
I can't think of a more unique way to experience the Eifel Tower and surrounds, 
than by launching from a 377-foot platform located on the tower itself!
Adventure junkies can dive at speeds of up to 56 miles per hour (90kmsph) 
and experience a phenomenal view of Pairs in the process.

<p class ="Zip Lines">This Dragon's Breath Zipline wins my vote for the best 
views and happens to the the world's longest zipline that runs over water.
Situated Haiti in the Caribbean (aka Paradise), this zipline provides panoramic 
views of the Harbour and the glistening water below.
Such a bucket-list worth activity and without a doubt one of the best
 ziplines in the world.</p>

<p class ="Zip Lines">Located in the heart of the Belize Jungle, the Jaguar Cave 
zipline will have you venture deep into an open-air cave.
Such a unique and memorable experience as you marvel at the surrounding stalagmites 
and stalactites, suspended from an impressive 100 foot ceiling.
Make sure you combine your experience with a spot of â€˜cave tubing', where you 
float on your back through the cave on a large rubber doughnut. Pure bliss.</p>

<p class ="Zip Lines">The Gibbon Experience is a zipline on a mission to promote forest conservation.
The zipline is part of Gibbon Experience Tours, an organization passionate about 
reforestation, sustainable farming practices and providing National Park patrols.
 So, it won't be just the rush of adrenaline that will leave you feeling great, 
it will also be the knowledge that you are supporting a great cause.</p>
